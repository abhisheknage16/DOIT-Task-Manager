===========================================
TESTING STRATEGY:
===========================================

PHASE 1: Basic Reads (Prompts 1-5)
- Verify agent can retrieve basic data

PHASE 2: Simple Filters (Prompts 6-22)
- Test single-parameter filtering

PHASE 3: Complex Filters (Prompts 23-28)
- Test multi-parameter filtering

PHASE 4: Write Operations (Prompts 29-39)
- Test task creation and assignment

PHASE 5: Advanced Queries (Prompts 40-60)
- Test natural language understanding

PHASE 6: Error Handling (Prompts 64-68)
- Verify graceful error responses

PHASE 7: RBAC (Prompts 69-71)
- Verify permission enforcement


===========================================
EXPECTED OUTCOMES:
===========================================

✅ SHOULD WORK:
- All read operations (prompts 1-60)
- Task creation by admin or members in their projects
- Task assignment by admin or members
- Email-based filtering (assigned_to_email parameter)
- Ticket ID resolution (FTP-005 format)

❌ SHOULD FAIL GRACEFULLY:
- Non-existent users/projects/tasks
- Members trying admin-only operations
- Invalid status/priority values
- Assignment to non-members

⚠️ PARTIALLY IMPLEMENTED:
- Sprint creation (endpoint exists in spec, no backend yet)
- Project creation (endpoint exists in spec, no backend yet)
- Task updates beyond assignment (endpoints exist, limited backend)
- Task deletion (endpoint exists in spec, no backend yet)


===========================================
NOTES:
===========================================

1. Always specify requesting user email when creating/assigning tasks
2. Use actual email addresses from your database
3. Project ID "698048b0255525b8208bafe3" is FastAPI Testing Project
4. Test users: testuser@gmail.com (admin), test2user@gmail.com, test3user@gmail.com
5. Task FTP-005 is "Fix login bug" assigned to test2user@gmail.com
6. Update Azure AI Foundry action before testing to ensure latest spec is loaded
